==== SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
- Extract function order in call graph that is memoized in DGSimplify for use
  elsewhere (in Parallelization currently)
  - The data structures in question: 
    parentFns, childrenFns, orderedCalled, preOrderedLoops
  - Consolidate LoopSummary * generated in this ordering with LoopInfoSummary

- Output results indexed by the above memoization for debug purposes, as well
  as to use in more advanced regression tests
  - Instead of just program correctness, tests can ensure certain loops are
    parallelized using a specific parallelization scheme


==== Renaming
generateStagesFromPartitionedSCCs -> generatePipelineStagesFromPartitionedSCCDAG


==== OTHER PARALLELIZATION SCHEMES
- Implement PS-DSWP

- Complete HELIX


==== BENCHMARKS
- Bring all PARSEC benchmarks

- Bring all MiBench benchmarks

- Bring all SPEC cpu2000, cpu2006, and cpu2017 benchmarks


==== OPTIMIZATIONS
- Packing/unpacking pushes and pops


==== PDG ALIAS ANALYSIS LIMITATIONS
- Non-pointer struct values alias with primitive arrays
- Primitive arrays stored and used in a struct
